Problem Statement ID 1674
Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)
Background: Use of encrypted messaging/social media apps like Telegram, WhatsApp and Instagram for drug trafficking are on the rise. Channels operating on Telegram and WhatsApp and Instagram handles are blatantly being misused by drug traffickers for offering various narcotic drugs and Psychotropic substances for sale.

Description: WhatsApp and Telegram channels and Instagram handles are created by drug traffickers to offer various drugs for sale to their subscribers. Customized Telegram bots are also created by some of the drug traffickers to sell drugs. It is most worrisome that majority of the drugs which are being offered on sale through Telegram, WhatsApp and Instagram are dangerous synthetic drugs like MDMA, LSD, Mephedrone etc. The above three apps are also used by drug traffickers for drug communication. Expected Solution:
Development of a software solution to identify live Telegram and WhatsApp channels/bots and Instagram
handles that are offering drugs for sale in India. Solution also should focus on triangulating identifiable parameters like IP address, mobile number, email id etc of the users behind the channel/bot/handle.
